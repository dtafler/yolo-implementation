# Implementing YOLO for the sake of understanding
The code in this repository represents some of my efforts in understanding object detection by working with YOLO. I implemented a YOLO-like loss function, some helper functions, toyed around with different model architectures, and trained some models to detect cars in satellite images. Details can be found in the report.
